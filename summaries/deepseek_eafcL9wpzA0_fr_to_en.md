  - The 2008 financial crisis and Greece's debt crisis illustrate how debt can lead to severe economic and social consequences, including austerity measures and political instability.

- **Modern Capitalism**:
  - The financialization of capitalism has created a system where markets dictate political decisions, often at the expense of democratic processes.
  - The concentration of wealth and power in the hands of financial elites exacerbates inequality and undermines social cohesion.
